Welcome to our Repo for our Final Project for CSC 212 at URI!

Within this repo we have added many files, including our .cpp files .txt files and .jpeg files

Instructions for compiling and running code\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download the source files (Sierpinski\+Triangle.\+cpp, Von\+Koch\textquotesingle{}s\+Snowflake.\+cpp, and \mbox{\hyperlink{hilberts_curve_8cpp}{hilberts\+Curve.\+cpp}})
\item Compile the code, for example for Von\+Koch\textquotesingle{}s\+Snowflake.\+cpp (in terminal) \textquotesingle{}g++ Von\+Koch\textquotesingle{}s\+Snowflake.\+cpp -\/o snow\textquotesingle{}
\item Run the code, for example \textquotesingle{}./snow\textquotesingle{}
\item (Depending on the program) The program will then ask for the level of complexity for the drawing (enter numbers 1-\/5 (or whatever the program prompts user for), 1 being simple 5 being complex
\item The program will then print \char`\"{}\+Process is complete\char`\"{}
\item The program made a new file eg. snowflake5.\+txt or triangle4.\+txt within the same directory as the source code
\item Copy all the contents from that text file
\item You can either test this code locally or through the use of our website (\href{https://andrewcampbell15.github.io/recursivegraphics/}{\texttt{ https\+://andrewcampbell15.\+github.\+io/recursivegraphics/}})
\item If you choose to test locally you will need to download \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{l-system-plotter_8py}{l-\/system-\/plotter.\+py}}\textquotesingle{} from our repo and run this code \textquotesingle{}python3 \mbox{\hyperlink{l-system-plotter_8py}{l-\/system-\/plotter.\+py}} YOUR\+\_\+\+SNOWFLAKE/\+TRIANGLE\+\_\+\+TXT\+\_\+\+FILE\+\_\+\+NAME.\+txt $<$output file name$>$ 60\textquotesingle{} 9a. If you would like to test hilbert\textquotesingle{}s curve, change the last value \textquotesingle{}60\textquotesingle{} to \textquotesingle{}90\textquotesingle{} since the turns will be 90 degrees.
\item If you test using the website simply paste the txt file documents where it says \textquotesingle{}instructions\textquotesingle{} (line 21). In line 23 if you are using either the Sierpinski Triangle or Von\+Koch\textquotesingle{}s Snowflake set the 3rd argument to 60. For the Hilbert Curve set it to 90. Once that is complete hit the run button.
\item Enjoy your shape!
